### 🎯 Who I Help
  

As a **Product Engineer**, I collaborate closely with teams to build scalable, user-focused products — not just ship features:

* ✅ Bridge engineering and product to align every sprint with real business outcomes
* ✅ Contribute across the stack for faster delivery, tighter feedback loops, and smoother collaboration
* ✅ Keep products healthy post-launch through lean iteration, observability, and thoughtful refactoring

As a **solo full-stack MVP builder**, I help early-stage, non-technical founders:

* ✅ Launch MVPs in 4–16 weeks (React, React Native, Django, Node.js)
* ✅ Work async with clean handoff or continuous iteration
* ✅ Stay lean post-launch with no-bloat monthly plans
